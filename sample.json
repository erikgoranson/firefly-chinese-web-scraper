        "usage": "Fei means \u201cwasted\u201d and hua means \u201cspeech,\u201d so together it means \u201can\u00a0unnecessary, nonsensical, or incorrect\u00a0statement.\u201d You could use it to reprove somebody like Mal does here, though you could also use\u00a0feihua in more playful, joking situations or for more sarcastic purposes. Like if you say to a pregnant friend on line at McDonalds, \u201cYou sure you want to eat here? It looks like you\u2019re packing on some weight there,\u201d she could sarcastically respond, \u201cFeihua\u201d to mean something like \u201cIsn\u2019t that obvious?\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t waste your breath\u201d or \u201cNo shit, Sherlock\u201d (if she doesn\u2019t knock you out first). Said on its own here as Mal does, it\u2019s a mild expletive meaning \u201cRubbish.\u201d",
        "execution": "Mal does a reasonable job pronouncing it. Does well with the tone on fei but the hua\u00a0doesn\u2019t fall as sharply. Even so, overall, it\u2019s one of Mal\u2019s better performances thus far.",

        "usage": "No way. I mean, what young Simon meant to say was \u201cNo way!\u201d in response to his sister, which I don\u2019t believe is well expressed with the phrase jian ta de gui (so also a \u201cNo way!\u201d from me on how they used the phrase). Jian ta de gui is a more fleshed out version of the oath jian gui, which literally means to \u201csee ghosts.\u201d It\u2019s just a catch-all phrase for when you\u2019re displeased with something, sort of like in English \u201cDamn.\u201d Ghosts can be inauspicious agents in Chinese culture, so saying \u201csee a ghost\u201d implies underworld, Devil type stuff. Jian ta de gui has the same overtones, except it literally means \u201csee your ghost.\u201d You can use it to swear at somebody (especially if you take offense at something they\u2019ve done or said) or as a general curse of your situation.",
        "execution": "Why Simon uses it here, I\u2019m not sure. Guides have translated it as \u201cLike hell (that\u2019s not true)!\u201d which is sort of a liberal interpretation of the phrase to try and have it fit the situation, but you need another follow-up sentence in order to really convey that sort of message otherwise it just sounds too much like a \u201cDamnnit!\u201d or \u201cTo hell with it!\u201d It would probably be best to add something like, \u89c1\u9b3c, \u7edd\u5bf9\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\uff01 (\u201cOh hell, that\u2019s definitely not possible!\u201d), but even then, it\u2019s something you probably wouldn\u2019t say when you and your sister are playing make-believe and she says something ridiculous. He\u2019s not taking offense at what she said (unless he\u2019s some sort of anti-Creationist extremist who\u2019d curse out his sister for pretending that dinosaurs and people might\u2019ve lived together at one time).\u00a0\u89c1\u9b3c, \u7edd\u5bf9\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd is\u00a0the kind of phrase a fed-up migrant worker would say if his boss asked him to do another 12-hour shift.\u00a0",
